<h4>ONLY FOR JEE AND NEET</h4>
  <h4> IF YOU ARE NOT IN JEE OR IN NEET KINDLY IGNORE </h4>

<p> NEET :The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), formerly the All India Pre-Medical Test (AIPMT) is an entrance examination in India for students who wish to study graduate and postgraduate medical courses (MBBS, MD, MS) and dental courses (BDS, MDS) in government or private medical colleges and dental colleges in India. The undergraduate NEET (UG), for MBBS and BDS courses, is currently conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), which provides the results to the Directorate General of Health Services at the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.[2] Prior to 2019, the test was administered by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in partnership with Prometric Testing Pvt Ltd headquartered in the USA.[3]. NEET-UG replaced the All India Pre Medical Test (AIPMT) and all individual MBBS exams conducted by states or colleges themselves in 2013. However, many colleges and institutes had taken a stay order and conducted private examinations for admission to their MBBS and BDS courses. Last NEET-UG was held on 6 May, 2018 and results were declared on 4 June of the same year. </p>
<p> JEE :
Joint Entrance Examination â€“ Main (JEE-Main), formerly All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE), is an examination organised by the National Testing Agency (NTA) in India.[2] Introduced in the year 2002, this national level competitive test is for admission to various undergraduate engineering and architecture courses in institutes accepting the AIEEE score, mainly National Institutes of Technology (NITs) and Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIITs).

The examination, originally called AIEEE, was renamed as Joint Entrance Examination (Main) in April 2017. The AIEEE was generally held on the last Sunday of April and results were announced in the last week of May or the first week of June. Post the rename, the exam is held in the first week of April. Candidates are ranked on an all-India basis and on state basis. Thus, they get an All India Rank (AIR) and a State Rank (SR).
